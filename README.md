## Background
In this assignment I took on the role as a data engineer employee at a fictional company called Pewlett Hackard.  
I was tasked with a research project about people that the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. 
The only data I had to work with included 6 CSV files with varying employee information.
I performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

# Data Modeling
    1. Inspected the CSV files 
    2. Created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of db tables and relationships. ERD.png

# Data Engineering
    1. Created a table schema for each of the 6 CSV files. employees_db_schema.sql
    2. Imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table

# Data Analysis
    1. Performed 8 queries to further understand the employee data. SQL_Challenge.sql
